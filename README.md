# Cyber Defense 2200

A space shooter video game made during AGDG 2017, for the "GAMES MADE QUICK???"
game jam (https://itch.io/jam/games-made-quick). Fully software rendered, and thus,
possibly not very fast on any given machine. Mostly fixed point math, and with 8-Bit 
RGB332 colour palette. Rasterizer ripped out from what was originally a demo running on 
a microcontroller.

Release binaries for windows and 64bit ubuntu can be found on http://halcy.itch.io/cyber-defense-2200 .
Source code (terrible) can be found on https://github.com/halcy/cyberdefense2200 .

Controls are relatively simple and explained in game.
